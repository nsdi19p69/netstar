The NetStar framework for buildling asynchronous network functions.

/netstar contains all the major source code.

There are several patches that we add to the original seastar library, you can find these patches by searching
the "patch by djp" keyword.

/tests/netstar contains several applications that we build with NetStar. 

We are still cleaning up the source code and we plan to release a more detailed instruction on how to use NetStar soon.
